* Short Term
** DONE Make prefix, etc., variables in [[file:Makefile::prefix%20usr%20local][Makefile]] overwritable by environment.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-11 Tue 09:11]
  This will allow Erik to avoid resolving when pulling in changes.
  Decided to just capitalize and document how to change them on CL.
  Using ?= seems dangerous.  Why?
** DONE SCR 1: debugopts doesn't work 
  CLOSED: [2010-05-12 Wed 10:21]
       mdb-next 'continues' when breakpoint is set with debugopts(stopat=[func,1]]).
       For example

       restart:  debugopts(stopat=[int,1]): int(x,x);
       # then type 'n';

       The problem is a binding issue; not sure why it occurs.
       Erik wrote quickstop; I added it to mdb.

** TODO Document customizations

** TODO Create an Instrument command/package.
  This would permit instrumenting any command in a package.
  Maybe this should be done with a Maplet, and be a stand-alone
  Maple package. 


** DONE Fix installation problem; getlibpath does not work
  CLOSED: [2010-05-12 Wed 10:19]
  Use scriptdir="$0" in scripts to find the other executables;
  that avoids dependency on user's PATH and allows getlibpath
  to work during installation.

** TODO Write mpldoc and create mdb.hdb.
** DONE Make work with Maple 13
  CLOSED: [2010-05-16 Sun 15:26]
  Added mdb-pre-Maple-14 customizable boolean variable.
** TODO Add menu to mdb-mode
* Long Term
 
** Handle large Maple output faster.
   This may require eliminating the transaction queue.
** Allow concurrent debuggers
   Once operational, extend to allow relative debugging.
   
** Implement tracking
** Associate output with statement
