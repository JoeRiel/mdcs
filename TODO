* Short Term

** TODO 


* Long Term
 
** TODO Handle exports of unnamed modules.
   1. The problem occurs when a module is assigned as
      M := module() ... end module.  Unless the module is
      saved and loaded from a library, the module technically
      does not have a name.  Consequently, showstat does not
      display the module name when an export is printed.
      This makes it impossible for the debugger to operate on the 
      correct procedure.
   2. One solution is to modify 'debugger' so that the current
      procedure name is stored in a global variable.  That, however,
      doesn't solve the problem if we open an inactive procedure,
      say by using the 'where' procedure.   
   3. Another solution, with the same limitation, but advantageous
      in that it does not require a change to 'debugger', is to
      elide the procedure name passed to showstat when inside
      the active procedure.
   4. The practical workaround is to name modules.  That does not
      work with constructed modules, that is, those returned by
      a procedure.  Do they have to be unnamed?
