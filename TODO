* Short Term
** DONE Make prefix, etc., variables in [[file:Makefile::prefix%20usr%20local][Makefile]] overwritable by environment.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-11 Tue 09:11]
  This will allow Erik to avoid resolving when pulling in changes.
  Decided to just capitalize and document how to change them on CL.
  Using ?= seems dangerous.  Why?
** DONE SCR 1: debugopts doesn't work 
  CLOSED: [2010-05-12 Wed 10:21]
       mdb-next 'continues' when breakpoint is set with debugopts(stopat=[func,1]]).
       For example

       restart:  debugopts(stopat=[int,1]): int(x,x);
       # then type 'n';

       The problem is a binding issue; not sure why it occurs.
       Erik wrote quickstop; I added it to mdb.

** TODO Document customizations

** TODO Create an Instrument command/package.
  This would permit instrumenting any command in a package.
  Maybe this should be done with a Maplet, and be a stand-alone
  Maple package. 


** DONE Fix installation problem; getlibpath does not work
  CLOSED: [2010-05-12 Wed 10:19]
  Use scriptdir="$0" in scripts to find the other executables;
  that avoids dependency on user's PATH and allows getlibpath
  to work during installation.

** TODO Write mpldoc and create mdb.hdb.
** DONE Make work with Maple 13
  CLOSED: [2010-05-16 Sun 15:26]
  Added mdb-pre-Maple-14 customizable boolean variable.
** TODO Add menu to mdb-mode
** TODO Font-lock the code output of mdb-where
   1. Alas, maplev doesn't provide a maplev-font-lock-region
      function.  May have to ask.  How to do that without
      assigning font-lock-defaults to the buffer?


* Long Term
 
** Handle large Maple output faster.
   This may require eliminating the transaction queue.
** Allow concurrent debuggers
   Once operational, extend to allow relative debugging.
   
** Implement tracking
** Associate output with statement   
** Set breakpoints in calling procedure(s)   
   * Using "where:" returns the name of the procedures on the stack
     and the corresponding lines (but not the statement numbers).
   * It wouldn't be hard to search for the line
   * As a preliminary, provide a means to open a non-current procedure
     in a showstat buffer.  Maybe a separate showstat-buffer.
     Breakpoints could then be set manually.

** Display non-debugged procedures in showstat
   1. This isn't hard to do; it can be done manually by calling
      mdb-update-showstat
   2. Debugger commands that execute code in the debugged procedure
     will still refer to the original procedure; consequently, they
     should be blocked while it is not being displayed.  Possibly they
     should just return to the original buffer.
   3. Is it better to reuse the buffer, or open another?  Reusing is
      easier and may cause less confusion, though there is some
      advantage to having multiple buffer open.  Hmm.  If Emacs
      had floating windows it might make sense, but ...
