This package provides an Emacs major mode, mdb, for debugging Maple
code.  It provides a frontend to the builtin Maple debugger that steps
through the interpreted source code.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
* GNU Emacs 22.2.1+
* The binary pmaple and shell script emaple.  

INSTALLATION
------------
Move mdb.el and ir.el to where Emacs can find them and (preferably)
byte-compile them.  Add the following to the .emacs file:

(autoload 'mdb "mdb" "Maple debugger" t)

USAGE
-----
Start mdb.

M-x mdb

This brings up a Maple prompt (with the default installation, the
prompt is the string "(**) ".  You can enter standard Maple commands.
The shell is currently rather crude.

To debug a procedure, instrument it in the usual way, that is,
by using the stopat procedure.  For example, to debug int, do

(**) stopat(int):

When int is executed, the debugger starts and mdb automatically
switches to the *showstat* buffer.

(**) int(x^2,x);

The showstat buffer maps single keys to debugger commands.

Tracing
-------
      c   continue
      i   into
      n   next
      o   outfrom
      q   quit
      r   return
      s   step
(space)  repeat last command

Breakpoints
-----------
Breakpoints can be set/cleared/queried.  To set a breakpoint,
move the cursor to the statement and type "b".

      b   breakpoint (set)
      p   print breakpoints
      u   unset breakpoint

Information
-----------
      a   print the arguments of the current procedure
      h   bring up Maple help page for debugger
      k   showstack
      l   return cursor to current state

Miscellaneous
-------------
      e   evaluate a Maple expression
      .   prettyprint a Maple expression (sort of)
C-c C-o   pop to mdb buffer
