This package provides a shell-script, emaple, and a binary, pmaple,
that implements an enhanced pipe-line interface to the Maple engine.
The enhancement is trivial but significant, it ensures that prompts
are flushed as they are generated.  This fixes a deficiency in cmaple,
which does not flush the prompts and thus makes it difficult to
determine when a computation is complete.

The shell-script, emaple, calls the binary pmaple after reassigning
and exporting the shell environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which
is used to determine where the Maple shared-object libraries are
located.  It also passes include options to pmaple.


BUILD
-----
To build pmaple, modify the Makefile, then run 

make

The Makefile uses the environmental variable MAPLE_ROOT,
which should point to the directory where Maple is installed.
If your environment does not assign MAPLE_ROOT consider
modifying the Makefile to assign it internally or do

MAPLE_ROOT="appropriate path" make

To install, modify emaple according to your setup and then run

make install
