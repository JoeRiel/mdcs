This package provides a shell-script, emaple, and a binary, pmaple,
that implements an enhanced pipe-line interface to the Maple engine.
The enhancement is trivial but significant, it ensures that prompts
are flushed as they are generated.  This fixes a deficiency in cmaple,
which does not flush the prompts and thus makes it difficult to
determine when a computation is complete.

The shell-script, emaple, calls the binary pmaple after reassigning
and exporting the shell environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which
is used to determine where the Maple shared-object libraries are
located.  It also passes include options to pmaple.

The Makefile uses the environmental variable MAPLE_ROOT,
which should point to the directory where Maple is installed.

BUILD
-----
To build pmaple, modify the Makefile as needed, then run

make

INSTALL
-------
The Make file installs the executables (binaries and associated
shell-scripts) into $HOME/bin.
