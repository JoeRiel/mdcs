This package provides a shell-script, emaple, and a binary, pmaple,
that implements an enhanced pipe-line interface to the Maple engine.
The enhancement is trivial but significant, it ensures that prompts
are flushed as they are generated.  This fixes a deficiency in cmaple,
which does not flush the prompts and thus makes it difficult to
determine when a computation is complete.

The shell-script, emaple, calls the binary pmaple after reassigning
and exporting the shell environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which
is used to determine where the Maple shared-object libraries are
located.  It also passes include options to pmaple.  

To build pmaple, modify the Makefile the run 

make

To install, modify emaple according to your setup and then run

make install
