* Method for Splicing and Dicing Packets

For now, assume this is the first read.

1. Read the first character, the lenlen bit.
2. lenlen says how many more are needed.
3. If they are there, read them.
4. Now determine the length of the remaining packet.
5. Assume we only have 10 of a needed 20 chars.
6. Save entire


(store-substring "012345678" 3 "abcdefghijklm")

Should we use buffers as temporary storage?
It does make it easier to
