;;{{{ Commentary

;; This package provides a major mode, mds-showstat, for debugging
;; Maple code.  It uses the Maple debugger to step through interpreted
;; Maple code, which is displayed in a buffer. It is not a true source
;; code debugger, that is, one that allows stepping through the source
;; *file*; however, it is the next best thing.

;; Hmm. What I really want is quite difficult to achieve.  An
;; interesting idea is to only look at selected keywords, say
;; builtins, to figure out position in the file.  Alas, that won't
;; always work.  Nothing---but build time tools---works with macros.
