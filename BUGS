* TODO SCR 1  debugopts doesn't instrument correctly

  If debugopts(stopat=[func,1]) is used to instrument the procedure func,
  the first time it is called any tracing command (next, into, etc)
  acts like a continue.  Stop points are ignored.  

  This is a strange error.  Note that debugopts is *not* intended
  for users, so this has a low priority.   It works find in smaple
  and emaple.  I've recorded the input sent to the engine and it
  seems fine.   

* DONE SRC 2  argument display is wrong with optional arguments that default to NULL

  Resolution: use seq instead of map to extract _params; the downside
  is that a global variable must be used, so must pick a safe one (_k).
